# Weapons_Pack.py
This is a python-programmed weapons pack for python games.
There's 5 or more functions (depending if i updated it or not)
and these functions act as weapons, they have their own logic, attack dmg, i also added a test-enemy
but i found a template for the weapons (im currently upgrading the weapon template).
I was originally going to make the repos when it was like 9 weapons but ehh whatever, if you have a problem submit a issue.
If you want to help me out add me on discord or steam. Anyway see ya next time i update this pack.
