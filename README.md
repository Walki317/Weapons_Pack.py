# Weapons_Pack.py
This is a python-programmed weapons pack for python games.
There are 15 weapons at the moment. 
We also added a test-enemy, to make sure you can test out the weapons pack before using it in your own game.
If you have a problem please submit a issue.
And if you want to help us out add us on discord or steam.
